    <h1>Playing the piano is surprisingly easy</h1>
    <p>
        I've been playing the violin for about 8 years now. Recently, I tried to learn how to play the piano.
        It is super easy, really.
        Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        On piano, the distance between each note is the same. But on string instruments, it changes.
        <br>
        On piano, both hands perform the same type of action. On the violin (and other instruments) 
        the left hand is usually used for changing the tune/note (whatever they're called in English) and the right hand for playing them. These are two
        different actions.
        <br>
        When you're playing the piano, you don't have to worry about the tune.
        When I'm practicing with my violin, I am constantly thinking about the notes I hear, and I even have
        to check with a tuner when in doubt.
        <br>
        On some string instruements (like the violin) there's no indication of where you are on the fingerboard, kind of. You can guess it but it isn't as clear as on the piano.
        On the piano it is pretty clear because of the black keys.
    </p>
    <p>The only thing that's a bit harder about playing the piano is that you have to read in two different keys.
        I am not really used to do that but I guess I will be one day.
    </p>
    Most piano pieces also follow some sort of a rhythmic and melodic pattern which makes "predicting" the next
    note much easier. On the violin though, I sometimes encounter some really strange changes in patterns that
    the passage almost seems impossible to play.
    <p>
        It's also much easier to play more 'emotionally' on the violin because of vibrato and how you 
        can move the bow.
    </p>
    <p>Both instruements are great! I enjoy playing both a lot. That's the most important thing.</p>
