        &emsp;The year is 2023. Big companies release new 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">
            GAI</a> (Generative Artificial Intelligence) chat bots every few weeks. OpenAI with ChatGPT, 
        Microsoft with Bing Chat and Copilot, Google with Bard, Snapchat with "My AI". These chat bots are not intelligent,
        but <strong>resemble</strong> intelligence, and the way they do it is very smart. They collect large collections of text data from websites, books, articles, etc.
        and use them in order to generate (or spit out) an answer. I bet there are thousands of people out there who started learning how to code because of what I call the "AI hype".<br>
        I'm just gonna go ahead and quote 
        <a href="https://generativeai.net/">generativeai.net</a>:<br>
        Generative AI has truly taken the world by storm, revolutionizing the way we communicate, work, and innovate. ChatGPT, with its 100 million users, stands as a testament to the rapid adoption and widespread impact of this cutting-edge technology. Its stable diffusion and popularity on GitHub only reinforce its transformative potential. Even in its early stages, generative AI is already shaping the future across various domains, and its influence on our lives is set to grow exponentially.

        &emsp;Those ~100 million people found out that GAIs can do 1% of what people can do, but a bit faster, and sometimes
        with a better quality (but keep in mind: GAI cannot always provide you with correct information). The problem is that these people are now panicking about their future, and that has caused a 
        very interesting existential dread!

        &emsp;In this article/essay we're going to study what questions people have asked themselves and try to find a logical answer for them.
