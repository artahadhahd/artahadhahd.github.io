                <summary>Programming?</summary>
                <p>Been programming for around 2/3 years? Mainly in C++, Python and TypeScript/JavaScript,
                    focusing on graphics programming, compilers, making cross-platform apps and web development.
                    But I've tried programming many stuff in the past - OCR for example - and I have experienced
                    a lot of the modern programming tools and exposed myself to different ecosystems and styles of writing code.

                <summary>Music taste?</summary>
                <p>One of my favorite bands is System of a Down, and I also love Queen and Van Halen. I have maybe a more old-fashioned taste,
                    but I love listening to English and Persian rappers like Jack Harlow, 50 cent, Eminem,
                    Hamid Sefat, and some other artists like Ali Azimi. I also listen to "phonk" from time to time, and a very little amount of beatboxing doesn't hurt.
                    But I am also kind of obsessed with 'virtuosic' classical music from the romantic era, like pieces from
                    Paganini, Wieniawski or Ernst. From Liszt, I only like his Dante Sonata and I am a great fan of Dvorak.
                    Tchaikovsky on top.
