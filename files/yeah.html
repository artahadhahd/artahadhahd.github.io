                        The FBIEPP is looking for volunteer philanthropists who could help prevent the death of
        endangered sea creatures and help the locals with famine by providing resources.
        As there is more and more plastic in the FooBar island, more fish are contaminated with
        toxic plastic waste. Sea creatures have also started dying rapidly, and it's vital to take action as quickly as possible.

                        Many innocent animals and children in poverty would be helped.
                        As of now, about 200 children and 430 adults are starving to death because there's not enough food on the Baz island, and everyday more than 100 fish cease to exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>And keep in mind: this is totally not a scam.</p>
