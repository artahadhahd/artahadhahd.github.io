        <p>
            Chapter 1:<br>
	        I think the narrator could've helped the adults with identifying what he had drawn by pointing out that it was a silhouette. But there are many ways to look at not only paintings, but also other types of art (e.g. music).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chapter 2:
	This chapter was kinda weird, because even though I've read this story 5 times, I don't know how the little prince interacts with paintings?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chapters 3 & 4:
	No thoughts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chapter 5:
	Little Prince's life feels like a fever dream.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            
Chapter 6 & 7:
no thoughts. I am starting to think my brain is empty
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
Chapter 8:
I think Little Prince is a bit lonely. How can you even talk with flowers? I am not even sure what type of creature he is!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chapter 9:
	I have no idea what happened
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Chapter 10: I feel like the author is trying to categorize types of people in this chapter.
